# Mason
Mason is a [compile-time plugin](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2021/plugins-in-go/) framework for [github.com/uber/fx](https://uber-go.github.io/fx/). Dependency injection is messy. Plugin systems are messy. This module was named after stone masons because it provides a simplistic API for pyramid building applications.
